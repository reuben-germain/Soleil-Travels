# This is a screenshot of my full Soleil Travels webpage

Within the *Navigation Menu Bar*, when you click on the menu options you will be taken to the relevant section.

Underneath the *Navigation Menu Bar* is a *Parallax* section. There are 3 beach pictures that change roughly every 5 seconds.

Underneath the *Parallax* section is a Search Destination input where when you type something inside the input, it will bring up a selection based on what letter is typed in.

Underneath the *Social Media icons* section is a *Photo Gallery* section. If you click on the gallery images they will pop out large and fill the screen, and will return back to a small image when clicked on again.

Also when you type inside the *'Please fill out form'* section, suggestions will pop up aswell.
